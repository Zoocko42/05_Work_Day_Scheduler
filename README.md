# 05_Work_Day_Scheduler
A handy scheduler for work-day hours, allowing you to enter a schedule for your day and check to see what event is coming up (or what you SHOULD be doing currently)!
### User Guide

The site will automatically show today's date on the dashboard; below the dashboard are several fields each set to an hour (from the normal workday schedule of 9AM-5PM).  The text fields change color depending on what hour it currently is; the current hour has a red background, hours that have already passed are grey, and hours that are still coming up are green.

The user can enter information into any of these fields; when they want to save the information they merely need to press one of the save buttons next to the field.  The value they have entered will be saved, and will be visible even on page refresh. To clear a field simply remove the information and hit save.
